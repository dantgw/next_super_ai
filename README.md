## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later
- AWS Account with access to:
  - Amazon Transcribe
  - Amazon Translate
  - Amazon Bedrock (with Llama 4 model access)
  - Amazon Polly
- Supabase account
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd health-reach
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**
Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:
```env
# AWS Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-west-2
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

4. **Set up Supabase Database**
Create a `summaries` table with the following schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE summaries (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  transcribed_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  translated_text TEXT,
  summary_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  transcript_language TEXT NOT NULL,
  translated_language TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

5. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Open your browser**
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📱 How It Works

### 1. **Start Consultation**
- Healthcare provider selects their language (e.g., English)
- Patient selects their preferred language (e.g., Spanish)
- Both parties can start recording simultaneously

### 2. **Real-Time Processing**
- Speech is transcribed in real-time using Amazon Transcribe
- Text is instantly translated using Amazon Translate
- Each participant sees the conversation in their preferred language

### 3. **AI Summarization**
- Consultation is processed by Llama 4 model via Amazon Bedrock
- Structured medical summary is generated with:
  - Patient presentation
  - Key symptoms
  - Medical recommendations
  - Treatment plans

### 4. **Delivery & Sharing**
- Summary is automatically emailed to the patient
- QR codes are generated for easy sharing
- Audio versions are available for accessibility

## 🌍 Supported Languages

The platform supports 11+ languages including:
- English (US/UK/Australian)
- Spanish (US/Spain)
- French
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese (Brazil/Portugal)
- Arabic
- Hindi
- Japanese
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Korean
